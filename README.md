# Opportunity API

The Opportunity API exists in the future roadmap of the OpenActive W3C Community Group.

The objective of the Opportunity API is to help provide guidance and create convergence for organisations that are providing search functionality over the top of the OpenActive feeds, such as [imin](https://www.imin.co/), which created the issues within this proposal to document its own efforts in this area.

Please note that this proposed API specification is NOT intended to be implemented directly by data publishers, as such an approach would not scale. See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQtsV8BEqHui358oC-0yZ4n7bQ93jkdpipp80U56Bf4/edit) for more background on this.

This repository can be used to capture proposals, issues and ideas for the upcoming specification.
